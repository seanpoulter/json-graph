# Aspiring to build JSON Graph from Netflix's _Falcor_ #

As the team at [Netflix UI Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGGRRqAjPm6sL3-WGBDnKJA) work to bring _Falcor_ to the open source community, this is an effort to implement JSON Graph with a similar API as the public demonstrations while learning to use Karma and Jasmine.


## Inspiration and Architecture ##

Here's to [Jafar Husain](https://twitter.com/jhusain) and the Netflix team for sharing their experience:

  * [JSON Graph: Reactive REST at Netflix](http://applicative.acm.org/speaker-JafarHusain.html) -- 2015-02-26 @ Applicative
  * [Netflix JavaScript Talks - Falcor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8UgDZ4rXBU) -- 2015-04-16 @ Netflix


## Status ##
Unit tests are passing for reference evaluation and Model.get():
```JavaScript
karma start karma.conf.js
```
